# Defect-Detection-on-Assembled-Electronic-Boards-with-YOLOv8
determined samples that include pictures of different failure modes on electronic boards and labels that created with Roboflow. some pictures created with different shape &amp; resolution &amp; another changes. few member of sample batch caused low accuracy for new samples for detect (predict). this model created with Yolov5 too.
beacause of better mAP, train4 selected.
